# documents — overview

Generates prescriptions, medical certificates, referral letters and
radiology requests as branded PDFs with configurable clinic letterhead
(name, logo, address, registration number).

## What it is

Standard clinic-scoped CRUD over a flat `GeneratedDocument` list:
create, list (filterable by patient, document type and status,
paginated), get, update (partial via `exclude_unset`), delete
(soft-delete / archive). A `POST /documents/generate` endpoint
renders the document as a branded PDF and publishes
`DOCUMENT_GENERATED` on the event bus (consumed by
`activity_journal`), and `GET /documents/{id}/download` streams the
rendered file.

Clinic letterhead overrides are configurable per clinic via
`GET/PUT /documents/settings/letterhead` (stored namespaced under
`clinic.settings["documents"]["letterhead"]`).

Cross-module reads: `patients` (for the patient demographics block in
the PDF). No cross-module writes. Prescription medication lines are
free text entered in the form — there is no catalog coupling.

## Document types

| Type | Key content fields |
|---|---|
| `prescription` | diagnosis, medications (name/dose/frequency/duration/notes), notes |
| `medical_certificate` | diagnosis, description, recommendations, valid_from, valid_until |
| `referral` | referred_to, specialty, reason, clinical_summary, notes |
| `radiology_request` | exam_type, region, clinical_question, notes |

Content is stored as JSONB — each document type has a Pydantic schema
that validates the structure, but the column itself is schemaless for
forward compatibility.

## Integrity guarantees

- Documents are scoped per clinic (every query filters by `clinic_id`).
- Soft-delete via `status` column (`draft` → `generated` → `archived`).
- No hard deletes — document history is preserved.

## PDF generation

The generate endpoint:
1. Fetches the document + clinic + patient.
2. Resolves the letterhead from `clinic.settings["documents"]["letterhead"]`,
   falling back per-key to the clinic's native profile (name, address,
   phone, email, tax_id).
3. Renders an HTML template (`pdf.py`) with the document content,
   patient demographics and clinic branding — `body`-only if
   WeasyPrint is unavailable it falls back to raw HTML.
4. Renders via WeasyPrint off the event loop (`asyncio.to_thread`,
   same pattern as billing).
5. Persists the file at `storage/documents/{clinic_id}/{document_id}.pdf`
   and stores the relative `file_path` on the row — only after the
   render succeeds does the status flip to `generated`, so no event
   fires for a document without a real file behind it.
6. Publishes `DOCUMENT_GENERATED`.

`GET /documents/{id}/download` streams the persisted bytes back as an
`application/pdf` attachment (404 if the document was never generated
or the file is missing; documents the download doesn't re-render).

## Data model

- `generated_documents` — `id`, `clinic_id`, `patient_id`,
  `document_type`, `title`, `status`, `content` (JSONB), `file_path`
  (nullable), `created_by` (nullable FK to `users.id`), timestamps.

## Lifecycle

`installable=True`, `auto_install=False` (ships inactive, the admin
activates it from the module admin UI), `removable=True`. Own Alembic
branch (`documents`), rooted independently on core `"0001"`. The
initial migration FKs to `patients.id`; because `patients` has no
branch label of its own, `doc_0001` declares
`depends_on = ("pat_0003",)` (same pattern as
`patient_relationships.prel_0001`) so a fresh install orders the
patients chain first.
