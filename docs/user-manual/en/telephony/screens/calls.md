# Call log

The call log lists every phone call the telephony gateway received —
matched to a patient when exactly one record owns the caller's number.

## Live calls

Calls currently ringing or in progress appear as a banner at the top of
the page (and as a pop-up toast anywhere in the app for staff with call
access). **Open record** jumps to the matched patient; for an unknown
caller, **Search patient** opens the patient list pre-filtered by the
number.

## The list

Each row shows when the call started, the caller (linked to the patient
record when matched), the number in international format, the status
(Ringing / Answered / Ended / Missed) and the duration. Filter by status
with the selector at the top right. Staff with write access can attach a
short note to a call from the API (UI affordance coming with the recall
integration).

## Requirements

The gateway must be configured by an administrator under Settings →
Integrations → Telephony (CTI): the clinic's PBX or a Zapier/Make
automation posts call events to the clinic's webhook URL, signed with
the secret shown at setup.
