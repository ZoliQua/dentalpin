"""A printed timestamp is the clinic's local time, never the server's.

A PDF is handed to a patient or filed by the clinic, so the hour on it
has to be the hour they experienced. Two shapes went wrong in the tree:

- ``date.today().strftime("%d/%m/%Y %H:%M")`` — a ``date`` has no time,
  so the footer always read **00:00**. Fixed in ``billing/pdf.py`` at the
  time (#204) and left standing in ``budget/pdf.py`` until #705.
- ``datetime.now()`` / a ``timestamptz`` column rendered as-is — the
  first is the *server's* zone (UTC in the container), the second is UTC
  because that is what the column holds. A budget signed at 01:15 in
  Madrid printed "23:15" on the signed PDF.

``billing/pdf.py`` and ``documents/pdf.py`` are the reference: resolve
``ZoneInfo(clinic.timezone or "UTC")`` once, then
``datetime.now(clinic_tz)`` for "now" and ``.astimezone(clinic_tz)``
before formatting a stored instant.

What this guard checks, and what it cannot: it sees the two shapes above
— a ``now()``/``today()`` without a zone, and a time-of-day format
applied to something that was not converted. A **date-only** format on a
``timestamptz`` column is invisible to it, because the same format is
correct on a ``Date`` column and a static scan cannot tell the two
apart; that is the shape the prescriptions date had (#705), and it needs
a reader, not a regex.
