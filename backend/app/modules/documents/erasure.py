Owns the ``documents`` coverage scope: generated prescriptions,

retains them and reports what it holds. Registered via
``DocumentsModule.get_erasure_contributors``; pulled by ``gdpr`` inside
the erasure transaction (ADR 0038).

    ``GeneratedDocument.content`` is a free-form JSONB snapshot of the

    prescription or certificate is retained under

    collects from active modules.
