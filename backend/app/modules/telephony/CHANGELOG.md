# Changelog — telephony module

## Unreleased

- fix(#723): the paginated list query now ends its `order_by` on the primary key. Rows that tied on the sort column (same date, name or timestamp) were cut from different orderings on each page, so some appeared twice and others on no page.

- feat(i18n): Hindi (`hi`) locale for the module's frontend layer.
- chore(#557): slot/settings permission gates now reference PERMISSIONS constants (no behavior change).

- feat(i18n): Telugu (`te`) locale for the module's frontend layer.
- feat(i18n): Arabic (`ar`) locale for the module's frontend layer.
- fix(#64): the three post-merge review follow-ups from #349 — the first-event unique-constraint race adopts the winner's row via a savepoint instead of failing; the `callPop` poll is gated on a new cheap `GET /status` probe (10-min re-check) so unconfigured clinics don't pay the 15s cadence; the plugin's seen-ids set is capped at 200.

- feat(#64): initial release — phase 1 of the CTI design: HMAC-verified
  inbound event webhook (any PBX / Zapier), E.164 normalization,
  caller→patient matching, persistent call log with live view and
  polling screen-pop toast, `call.*` bus events, settings page with
  show-once signing secret.
